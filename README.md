# COVID-19_Prediction_and_Visualization
Exploring, Visualizing, and Predicting the Future Number of COVID-19 Cases in Indonesia and around the World.

### Introduction

In this notebook, I try to track the spread of novel Coronavirus or also known as COVID-19. This notebook focuses on the cases in Indonesia as well as comparing the cases in around the world. Visualization in this project using Matplotlib for generating graphs such as line plot, bar chart either vertical or horizontal, area plot, and pie chart. I also predict the number of cases for the next 10 days using regression algorithms such as Polynomial Regression, Polynomial Bayesian Ridge, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 

### Data

I use time series data from data repository created by John Hopkins CSSE that can be found in this link https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The data is updated daily.
